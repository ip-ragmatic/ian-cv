        <p class="profile-description">
          I am a student and am pursuring a Bachelor's degree in Computer
          Engineering and Master's degree in Computer Science. I have programmed
          computers since I was 8, and have deep appreciation for the complexity
          behind technology. So much so that I spend hours (probably an
          unhealthy amount) programming every day. For some reason I also love
          eating spicy food.

          <h3>Focus.</h3>
          <p class="skill-description">
            I'm an individual that when I find something that interests me, I
            lock into that thing and focus on the objective at hand. I break
            down the objective and complete each step until completion.

          <h3>Learning.</h3>
          <p class="skill-description">
            My desire to learn, I feel, is the reason I have an obsession with
            technology. I want to learn all there is to know; and because
            technology is constantly improving, there will always be a way for
            me to improve as an engineer.

          <h3>Eating Spicy Food.</h3>
          <p class="skill-description">
            Spicy food tricks the mind into thinking one's mouth is burning even
            though it isn't. Because of this, I feel that eating spicy food is a
            way to build mental fortitude. I have been eating spicy food since I
            was a kid and for some reason I love it.
